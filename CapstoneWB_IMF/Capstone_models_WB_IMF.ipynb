    "## Background & Context\n",
    "GDP per capita is a measure of a country's economic output divided by its population size. It is important to measure it because it gives a good indication of a country's economic health and the standard of living of its citizens. It is also a useful tool for comparing the economic performance of different countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction of GDP per capita is important in order to gauge the economic performance of a country over time. It can be used to help inform policy decisions and measure the effects of economic policies. By predicting future GDP per capita, policymakers can better understand the likely effects of their decisions and make more informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As data scientists, we must come up with models that can predict GDP per capita in order to help inform policy decisions and measure the performance of economic policies. By using predictive models, data scientists can better understand the likely effects of policy decisions and provide policy makers with important insights into the economic performance of a country. These models also allow for better comparisons between countries and regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The objectives:**\n",
    "* Explore and visualize the dataset.\n",
    "* Build a model to predict the GDP per Capita.\n",
    "* Generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help countries in their GDP forecasting and predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The key questions:**\n",
    "* Which factors would affect the GDP per Capita of a country?\n",
    "* Is there any difference between the poor and rich?\n",
    "* Do poor countries grow faster than rich countries? \n",
    "\n",
    "### **The problem formulation**:\n",
    "We have a regression problem at hand where we will try to predict the GDP per capita based on several factors derived from our dataset from World Bank and IMF\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The World Bank Indicators data: that includes hundreds of economic and social indicators including GDP, population, inflation, labor force, energy use, poverty levels, and education. It also includes data on health, natural resources, and the environment. The data is sourced from a variety of international organizations and can be used to compare the performance of countries and regions on a variety of measures.\n",
    "* The International Monetary Fund (IMF) data:  that includes economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, exchange rates, public debt, and balance of payments. It also includes data on trade, investment, and financial flows. The data can be used to measure the performance of countries and regions and compare them over time."

    "\n",
    "**Overall solution design** : \n",
    "\n",
    "The potential solution design would look like:\n",
    "* Checking the data description to get the idea of basic statistics or summary of data.\n",
    "* Univariate analysis to see how data is spread out, getting to about the outliers.\n",
    "* Bivariate analysis to see how different attributes vary with the dependent variable.\n",
    "* Outlier treatment if needed - In this case, outlier treatment is not necessary as outliers are the rich countries and we would want our predictive model to capture the underlying pattern for them.\n",
    "* Missing value treatment using appropriate techniques.\n",
    "* Feature engineering - transforming features, creating new features if possible.\n",
    "* Choosing the model evaluation technique - 1) R Squared 2) RMSE , can be any other metrics related to regression analysis.\n",
    "* Splitting the data and proceeding with modelling.\n",
    "* Model tuning to see if the performance of the model can be improved further.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measures of success** :\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared and RMSE can be used as a measure of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared: This will tell us how much variation our predictive model can explain in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE: This will give us a measure of how far off the model is predicting the original values on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Building\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What we want to predict is the \"GDP per Capita\". We will use the normalized version 'GDP per capita' for modelling.\n",
    "2. We are luck there are no categorical features for encoding.  \n",
    "3. We'll split the data into train and test, to be able to evaluate the model that we build on the train data.\n",
    "4. Build Regression models using train data.\n",
    "5. Evaluate the model performance."
